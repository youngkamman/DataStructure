    What is the runtime complexity of your solutions for Step 1 and Step 2?
    step 1 O(1)
    step 2 O(n)

    What is the runtime complexity for each solution?
    solution 1 O(n)
    solution 2 O(1)

    How do the solutions compare to yours? What improvements do you think you could have made to your solution?
they are the same
    How would the implementation of the Stack from Step 3 change if you were to implement a queue?
    i would be adding things to the back of the array and removing things from the front
